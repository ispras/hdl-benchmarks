NO WARRANTY 

Because the library is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty

otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties 
provide the library "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed

merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as 
to the quality and performance of the library is with you. Should the 
library prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, 
repair or correction. 

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing 
will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or 
redistribute the library as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, 
including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising 
out of the use or inability to use the library (including but not limited to 
loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or 
third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software), 
even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of 
such damages.
