These designs were developed by Faraday Technology Corporation, a fabless ASIC
vendor and silicon Intellectual property (SIP) provider in order too compare
Faraday's Structured ASIC library with other vendors'.

The designs were downloaded from the webpage at
http://www.faraday-tech.com/StructuredASIC/download.html.

Three commonly used functional blocks:

DSP:  16-bit digital signal processor (DSP) with SRAM blocks
RISC: 32-bit RISC CPU
DMA:  Direct Memory Access (DMA) Controller
